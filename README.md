=====
#### This is an app to help DJ's and music fans dynamically create soundclound playlists based on other published track listings on other sites.  We've started with referencing [Resident Advisor's](http://residentadvisor.com) Monthly Top 50 charts with plans to add more charts (i.e. [Beatport](http://beatport.com))
=========

#####This app will use the [Soundcloud API](http://developers.soundcloud.com/docs), and [Nokogiri](http://developers.soundcloud.com/docs).  Incorporates [Soundcloud-Ruby gem](https://github.com/soundcloud/soundcloud-ruby).
